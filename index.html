        <h1>Data Virtualization</h1>
        <p>Data virtualization is a technique for sourcing data from various repositories using an abstraction layer to get access to useful data and presenting it in a single centralized virtual view for end users/applications over the internet.</p>
	<p>It hides the complexities associated with integrating this data like the format or where it is physically stored and can be accessed virtually from anywhere with any device or system simultaneously making it available for analytics and effective decision making without duplicating or storing them.</p>
        <h1>How Data virtualization works</h1>
        <p>Basically, data virtualization works by connecting to different sources of data to provide one single point where it can be accessed. The process involves abstracting, federating, transforming and delivering data from different sources which is broken down into three steps/layers.</p>
        <ul>
          <p><li> <b>Connect Layer:-</b> This layer uses specialized connectors like IDBC/ODBC to connect to different sources like databases, the web, cloud repositories, etc and then virtualize the data into an abstract format. This layer ensures connection to all types of data sources hiding the complications of connection/communication protocols, location and format of the outsourced data.</p></li>
          <p><li><b>Combine Layer:-</b> In this layer, data is combined based on the requirements of the consumer and then integrated into virtual views. Users use SQL and tools that they are familiar with to combine data from different sources performing tasks like data transformation and metadata modeling because the layer automates web integration processes.</p></li>
          <p><li><b>Consume Layer:-</b> In this layer, the virtual views are then published as data services to the consuming applications/end users. This layer enables the users to use data that has been combined from different sources using application to connect to a single point of access offering data delivery options.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Benefits of Data Virtualization</h1>
        <ul>
        	<p><li><b>Saves Cost:</b> The cost needed for maintaining, copying, transforming and storing data from different formats and locations is minimal because there is no need for data transfer.</p></li>
        	<p><li><b>Reduce risk of data errors:</b> Sourcing information from various sources tends to create some loss or error in the report which can be avoided using data virtualization.</p></li>
        	<p><li><b>It provides access to real time data:</b> Data is readily available for efficient and effective decision making which helps managers to be more efficient, competitive and make decisions in real-time.</p></li>
        	<p><li><b>It eliminates the need for data storage:</b>  Data is accessed directly from different sources without need to store extra data since it provides real-time access.</p></li>
        	<p><li><b>Enhanced security and data governance:</b> It helps in keeping critical data safe from unauthorized users since the need of storage is eliminated and direct access is provided.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Types of Data Virtualization</h1>
        <ul>
        	<li><p><b>Data blending:</b> This is a method of combining data from different databases from different sources into one useful single view to merge abstracted data using utilities like tableau to offer additional data visualization for effective decision making.
</p></li>
        	<li><p><b>Data virtualization platforms:</b> Data virtualization platforms like Denodo, Red Hat, Oracle Data Service Integrator offer different software suites to reduce IT costs, boost information accessibility and strengthen data integrity. For example Denodo offers a tool which helps to manage metadata with a visual editor that presents an accurate report of data.
</p></li>
        	<li><p><b>Sql functionality:</b> the use of standard structured query language functions to combine files and folders from databases by using queries against larger datasets that exist across multiple systems, thereby eliminating the need to relocate them to a single system that may or may not have enough free disk space.
</p></li>
        	<li><p><b>Cloud data services:</b> often featured in software-as-a-service packages like salesforce.com  to give a broad selection of analytical services, maintaining compatibility with various cloud platforms.</p></li>
